# CiFAR-10-Images-Classification-Using-CNNs_AN


CIFAR-10 Loading: The cifar10.load_data() function loads the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is split into 60,000 images. We normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1] for better model performance and convert the labels into one-hot encoding using tf.keras.utils.to_categorical().

CNN Model: The model architecture uses three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, a flatten layer, and dense layers for classification. The output layer has 10 units (one for each class in CIFAR-10) with a softmax activation for multi-class classification.

Data Augmentation: The ImageDataGenerator is used to perform real-time data augmentation. The augmentation includes rotation, width/height shift, shear, zoom, and horizontal flip.

Model Training: The model is trained using the augmented data generated by train_datagen.flow(). This allows real-time augmentation during the training process.

Model Saving: After training, the model is saved to a file in the saved_models directory with the name cifar10_trained_model_Augmentation.h5.

- CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of several images divided into the following 10 classes: 
    - Airplanes
    - Cars 
    - Birds
    - Cats
    - Deer
    - Dogs
    - Frogs
    - Horses
    - Ships
    - Trucks

- The dataset stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR)
- CIFAR-10 is widely used for machine learning and computer vision applications. 
- The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images and 6,000 images of each class.
- Images have low resolution (32x32).
